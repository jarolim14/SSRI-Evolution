    "# General Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "In this analysis, we explore the clustering of scientific publications using the Leiden algorithm, with a focus on adjusting the algorithm's parameters to improve the coherence and relevance of the clusters formed. The Leiden algorithm, which improves upon the limitations of modularity optimization seen in previous methods, is employed for its effectiveness in identifying communities within networks. We particularly experiment with various resolution parameters, iterating through a range of values to tune the granularity of the clustering results. The objective is to find an optimal balance where clusters are neither too broad, encompassing multiple unrelated topics, nor too narrow, breaking down coherent subjects into excessive subgroups.\n",
    "\n",
    "The analysis starts with the application of the Leiden algorithm using default settings and then progresses to more sophisticated implementations, including adjusting the resolution parameter to influence the size and coherence of clusters. This parameter tuning is crucial for addressing the resolution limit problem inherent in modularity-based community detection methods. By carefully selecting resolution parameters, we aim to achieve a set of clusters that are meaningful and manageable for qualitative analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process is supported by the creation of summary sheets and detailed exploratory sheets for each parameter set, facilitating a thorough review of the clustering outcomes. Parameters leading to the most coherent and distinct clusters, based on predefined decision criteria, are identified and selected for further analysis. The final selection of parameters is based on qualitative assessments of cluster coherence, ensuring that the clusters formed are both scientifically relevant and insightful for further research explorations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notes about the leiden algorithm:\n",
    "\n",
    "### The most simpe implementation is this:\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we would just use all default parameters.\n",
    "The metrices are good, the qualitative assessment poor.\n",
    "The `ModularityVertexPartition` is the default partitioning algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "- it is based on the modularity measure (link density within communities vs. link density between communities)\n",
    "- Higher scires = stronger division into communities\n",
    "- It tries to maximize the modularity score\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem here is that the partitions are really big (if run without max_comm_size, around 5,000 papers in the largest communit)\n",
    "Examining the most central articles (based on the eigenvector similarity), they do not seem coherent.\n",
    "\n",
    "**PROBLEM:** Modularity, though\n",
    "robust for many practical applications, suffers from the resolution limit problem,\n",
    "in which optimization may fail to identify clusters smaller than a certain scale\n",
    "that is dependent on properties of the network. (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.09644.pdf)\n",
    "\n",
    "### The second implementation is this:\n",
    "\n",
    "We are trying to tune the resolution parameter. To access it, we use the CPMVertexPartition algorithm. (CPM = Constant Potts Model)\n",
    "This means that modularity is not an important parameter anymore.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The resolution parameter is the only parameter of this algorithm\n",
    "- It compares the actual link density to the resolution parameter\n",
    "- If the link density is higher than the resolution parameter, the nodes are put into the same community\n",
    "- It has a quality attribute, which is similar to the modularity score\n",
    "- We will not rely on this but use a qualitative analysis to assess the results\n",
    "\n",
    "In previous papers (Waltman 2020a, Ahlgren 2020), the authors used different levels of granularity. They used 10 different values of the resolution parameter γ: 0.000001, 0.000002, 0.000005, 0.00001, 0.00002, 0.00005, 0.0001, 0.0002, 0.0005, 0.001, 0.002, 0.005, 0.01\n",
    "\n",
    "We decide to use the following resolution parameter to narrow down our search.\n",
    "0.00001,0.00002,0.0001,0.0002,0.001,0.002,0.01,0.02,\n",
    "\n",
    "We then evaluated the solutions\n"
