    "# Creating the Network\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook creates two types of networks from the bibliometric data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A weighted undirected network that combines citation relationships with semantic similarity\n",
    "2. A directed unweighted network representing pure citation relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "## Weighted Undirected Network Creation Process\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input Data\n",
    "\n",
    "- DataFrame containing paper information including:\n",
    "  - Text embeddings (SPECTER2)\n",
    "  - Citation relationships\n",
    "  - Metadata (year, title, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Network Construction Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Semantic Similarity Calculation**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Use k-nearest neighbors (kNN) algorithm to find similar papers\n",
    "   - Calculate cosine similarity between paper embeddings\n",
    "   - For each paper, find k most similar papers (k ∈ {5, 10, 15, 20})\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Edge Weight Calculation**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Combine two types of relationships:\n",
    "     - Semantic similarity: weight = cosine_similarity \\* (1 - α)\n",
    "     - Citation relationship: weight = 1 \\* α\n",
    "   - α ∈ {0.3, 0.5} controls the balance between semantic and citation relationships\n",
    "     - An alpha of 0.3 means that citation relationships are given 30% of the maximum weight\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Matrix Symmetrization**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Make the adjacency matrix symmetric by:\n",
    "     - Averaging weights when both directions exist\n",
    "     - Using the non-zero weight when one direction is zero\n",
    "     - Setting zero when both directions are zero\n",
    "   - Keep only the upper triangular part to avoid duplicate edges\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Network Creation**\n",
    "   - Create an undirected weighted network from the symmetric matrix\n",
    "   - Add paper metadata as node attributes\n",
    "   - Save network statistics and visualization\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output\n",
    "\n",
    "- GraphML file containing the weighted network\n",
    "- Statistics log with:\n",
    "  - Number of nodes and edges\n",
    "  - Percentage of edges from citations vs. semantic similarity\n",
    "  - Network density and other metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "## Directed Citation Network Creation Process\n",
    "\n",
    "### Input Data\n",
    "\n",
    "- Same DataFrame as above, focusing on citation relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "### Network Construction Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Node Creation**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Create nodes for each paper using unique identifiers\n",
    "   - Add paper metadata as node attributes\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Edge Creation**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - Create directed edges based on citation relationships\n",
    "   - Edge direction: citing paper → cited paper\n",
    "   - No weights assigned (unweighted network)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Network Analysis**\n",
    "   - Calculate basic network statistics\n",
    "   - Identify isolated nodes\n",
    "   - Generate network metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "### Output\n",
    "\n",
